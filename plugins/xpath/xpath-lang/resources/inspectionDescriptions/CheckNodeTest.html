<p>
  Reports any element or attribute names that are used in XPath-expressions, which are not part of an
  associated XML file and are not defined in a referenced schema. This helps to avoid problems caused by typos in
  XPath-expressions that would otherwise occur when running the script and may even then not be recognized immediately.
</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>
  <code>&lt;xsl:template match="<b>h:txtarea</b>" /></code>
</p>

<p>
  If the prefix "h" is bound to the XHTML namespace, the inspection will flag this part of the match-expression as an
  unknown element name because the correct name of the element is "textarea".
