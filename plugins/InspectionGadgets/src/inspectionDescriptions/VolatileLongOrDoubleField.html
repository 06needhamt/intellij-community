This inspection reports fields of t<b><font color="#000080">long</font></b> or <b><font color="#000080">double</font></b>
which are declared as <b><font color="#000080">volatile</font></b>.  While Java specifies that reads
and writes from such fields are atomic, many JVM's have violated this specification. Unless you
are certain of your JVM, it is better to syncronized access to such fields rather than declare them <b><font color="#000080">volatile</font></b>.
