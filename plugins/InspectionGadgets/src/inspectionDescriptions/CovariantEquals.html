Reports <code>equals()</code> methods taking an argument type other than
<code>java.lang.Object</code> if the containing class does not have another
<b>equals()</b> method which does take <code>java.lang.Object</code> as
its argument type.
<p>
  A covariant version of <code>equals()</code> does not override the
  <code>Object.equals(Object)</code> method. It may cause unexpected
  behavior at runtime. For example, if the class is used to construct
  one of the standard collection classes which expect that the
  <code>Object.equals(Object)</code> method is overridden.
