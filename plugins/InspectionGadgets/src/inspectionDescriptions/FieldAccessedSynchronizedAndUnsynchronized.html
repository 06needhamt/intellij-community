This inspection reports any instances of non-final fields which are accessed in both synchronized and unsynchronized contexts.
Accesses in constructors an initializers are ignored for purposes of this inspection.  Such "partially synchronized" access
is often the result of a coding oversight, and may result in unexpectedly inconsistent data structures.
