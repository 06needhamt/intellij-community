Reports non-final fields which are accessed in both <code>synchronized</code> and
unsynchronized contexts. <code>volatile</code> fields and accesses in constructors and initializers are ignored by this
inspection. Such "partially synchronized" access is often the result of a coding oversight, and may
result in unexpectedly inconsistent data structures.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre>
  public class Program {
    Console console; // warning: Field 'console' is accessed in both synchronized and unsynchronized contexts

    public void execute() {
      synchronized(console) {
          console.print("running");
      }
    }

    public void check() {
      console.check();
    }
  }

</pre>

Use the checkbox below to specify if simple getters and setters are counted as accesses too.
