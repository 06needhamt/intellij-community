This inspection reports any instances of abstract classes which have precisely one
direct inheritor.   While such classes may offer admirable clarity of design, 
in memory-constrained or bandwidth-limited environments, they needlessly increase the total footprint of the application.  Consider
merging the abstract class with it's inheritor.
