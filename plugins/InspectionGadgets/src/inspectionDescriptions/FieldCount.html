This inspection reports any instances of class with too many fields.  Classes with
a large number of fields are often trying to 'do too much', and may need to be
refactored into multiple smaller classes.

Use the controls provided below to specify the maximum acceptable number of fields class might have, and
to indicate whether constant fields count toward this number.
