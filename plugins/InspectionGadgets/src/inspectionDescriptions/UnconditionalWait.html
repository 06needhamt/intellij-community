This inspection reports any instances of <b><font color="#000080">.wait()</font></b>
being called unconditionally within a synchronized context.
Normally, <b><font color="#000080">.wait()</font></b> is
used to block a thread until some condition is true.  If <b><font color="#000080">.wait()</font></b>
is called unconditionally, that often indicates that the condition was checked before a lock was
acquired.  In that case a data race may occur, with the condition becoming true between the time
it was checked and the time the lock was acquired.  While constructs found by this inspection
are not necessarily incorrect, they are certainly worth examining.
