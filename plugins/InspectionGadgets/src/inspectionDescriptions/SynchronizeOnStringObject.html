This inspection reports any <b><font color="#000080">synchronized</font></b>
block which locks on an instance of <b><font color="#000080">java.lang.String</font></b>.
Because strings can be interned, it is possible that some other part of the system
which uses a string with the same contents, is actually holding a reference to the
same object. This can create unexpected dead-lock situations, if the string was
thought to be private.
