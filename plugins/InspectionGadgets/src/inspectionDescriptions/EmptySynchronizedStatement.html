Reports <code>synchronized</code> statements having empty bodies.
Empty synchronized statements are sometimes used to wait till other threads
release a particular resource. However, nobody guarantees that the same resource
won't be acquired again right after the empty synchronized statement finishes.
For proper synchronization, the resource should be utilized inside the synchronized block.
<p>
  Also, empty synchronized block may appear during the refactoring 
  when redundant code was deleted. In this case, the synchronized block
  itself will be redundant and should be deleted as well.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  synchronized(lock) {}
</code></pre>
<p>
  A quick-fix is suggested to remove empty synchronized statement.
