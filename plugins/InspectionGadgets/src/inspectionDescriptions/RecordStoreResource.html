Reports any Java ME <code>RecordStore</code> resource which is not opened in front of a <code>try</code>
block and closed in the corresponding <code>finally</code> block.
<p>Such resources may be inadvertently leaked if an exception is thrown before the resource is closed.</p>
<p>
  This inspection is intended for Java ME and other highly resource constrained environments. Applying
  the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and
  design.
