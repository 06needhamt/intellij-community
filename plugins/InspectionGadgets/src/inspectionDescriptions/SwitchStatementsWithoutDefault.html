Reports <code>switch</code> statements that do not contain <code>default</code> labels. 
Adding <code>default</code> label guarantees that all possible scenarios are covered and it becomes
easier to make assumptions about current state of a program.
<p>
Note that by default inspection doesn't report <code>switch</code> on <code>enum</code> if all enum cases are covered. 
This can be changed using option below.
