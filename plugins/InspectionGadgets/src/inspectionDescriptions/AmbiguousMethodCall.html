This inspection reports any method calls to a super method, but a method
with the same name is available in a surrounding class. In this case a cursory
reader of the source may think that the method in the surrounding class is
called when in fact the method from the super class is called. To make the
intent of the code more clear add a this qualifier to the method call.
