Reports any methods which override methods in a superclass but do not have the <code>@java.lang.Override</code> annotation.
Having annotation is good for readability because it shows intent. Also in this case compiler emits error when signature of the
overridden method doesn't match super class method.

<p>
  Use the first checkbox below to have this inspection ignore the
  <code>java.lang.Object</code> methods
  <code>equals()</code>,
  <code>hashCode()</code> and
  <code>toString()</code>. The risk that these methods will disappear and thus your code won't be compiling anymore due to the
  <code>@Override</code> annotation is vanishingly small.

<p>
  Use the second checkbox below to have this inspection ignore overriding methods in anonymous classes.
</p>
<p>This inspection only reports if the language level of the project or module is 5 or higher</p>
