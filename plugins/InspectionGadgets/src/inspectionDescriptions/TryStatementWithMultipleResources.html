Reports <code>try</code> statements with multiple resources that can be automatically split into
multiple try-with-resources statements. This conversion can be useful for further refactoring
(e. g., extracting the nested <code>try</code> statement into a separate method). 
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  try (FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream("in.txt");
     FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("out.txt")) {
     /*read and write*/
  }
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied the result looks like:</p>
<pre>
  try (FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream("in.txt")) {
    try (FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("out.txt")) {
      /*read and write*/
    }
  }
</pre>
