This inspection reports any variables which may be declared with a weaker type. For instance,
a variable may be of type <b><font color="#000080">ArrayList</font></b>, and only the method
<b><font color="#000080">isEmpty()</font></b> is called on it. In this case the type
<b><font color="#000080">List</font></b> would do just as well.
<br>
Enable the option below to prevent weakening the left side of assignments when the right side is not
a type cast or new expression. When storing the result of a method call in a variable, it is
useful to retain the type of the method call result instead of unnecessarily weakening it.
