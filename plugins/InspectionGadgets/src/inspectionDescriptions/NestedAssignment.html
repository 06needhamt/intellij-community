Reports assignment expressions nested inside other expressions. While admirably terse,
such expressions may be confusing, and violate the general design principle that a given construct should do precisely one thing.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  String userName;
  // Warning: result of assignment to 'userName' is used
  System.out.println("Hello " + (userName = "Alice") + "!");
  System.out.println("Goodbye " + userName);
</pre>
