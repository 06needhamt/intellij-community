This inspection reports any calls to <b><font color="#000080">start()</font></b> on <b><font color="#000080">java.lang.Thread</font></b>
or any of it's subclasses during object construction.  While occasionally useful, this construct should be avoided due
to inheritance issues.  Subclasses of a class which lauches a thread during object construction will not have finished
any initialization logic of their own before the thread has launched.
