Reports any I/O resource which is not safely closed. I/O resources checked
by this inspection include <code>java.io.InputStream</code>,
<code>java.io.OutputStream</code>, <code>java.io.Reader</code>,
<code>java.io.Writer</code>, <code>java.util.zip.ZipFile</code> and <code>java.io.RandomAccessFile</code>.

"java.util.zip.ZipFile", "java.io.Closeable"
I/O resources which are wrapped by other I/O resources
are not reported, as the wrapped resource will be closed by the wrapping resource.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  void save() throws IOException {
    FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("filename.txt"); //warning
    writer.write("sample");
  }
</pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the table below to specify which I/O resources should be ignored by this inspection.
Specify I/O resource classes here which do not need to be closed.
</p>
<p>
Use the first checkbox below to specify if an I/O resource is allowed to be opened <code>inside</code> a <code>try</code>
block. This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a resource in front of a <code>try</code>
block.
</p>
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to specify that the inspection should not warn if an I/O resource is passed as a method call argument.
If enabled the inspection assumes the resource is closed in the called method.
Method calls inside a <code>finally</code> block with <code>close</code> in the name and an I/O resource argument will not be ignored.
