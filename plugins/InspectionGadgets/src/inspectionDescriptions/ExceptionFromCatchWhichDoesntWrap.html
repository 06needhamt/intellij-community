This inspection reports on instances of exceptions constructed and thrown
from inside <b><font color="#000080">catch</font></b> blocks, which do not "wrap" the caught
exception.  It is considered good practice when throwing an exception in response to an exception
to wrap the initial exception, so that valuable context information
such as stack frames and line numbers are not lost.
