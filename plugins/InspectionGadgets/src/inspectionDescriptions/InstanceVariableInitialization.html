This inspection reports instances of instance variables which are not guaranteed to be initialized upon object initialization.
<p>
Use the checkbox below to indicate whether you want uninitialized primitive fields to be reported.
<p>
Note: This inspection uses a very conservative dataflow algorithm, and may report instance variables
as uninitialized incorrectly.  Variables reported as initialized will always be initialized.
