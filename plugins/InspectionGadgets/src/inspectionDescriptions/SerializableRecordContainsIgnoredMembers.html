Reports members <code>writeObject</code>, <code>readObject</code>, <code>readObjectNoData</code>, <code>writeExternal</code>,
<code>readExternal</code>, <code>serialPersistentFields</code> defined in <code>record</code> class.
These members are ignored during serialization/deserialization of records.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  record R1() implements Serializable {
    @Serial
    private static final ObjectStreamField[] serialPersistentFields = new ObjectStreamField[0]; //The field is ignored during record serialization
    @Serial
    private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException { //The method is ignored during record serialization
    }
  }
</pre>
<pre>
  record R2() implements Externalizable {
    @Override
    public void writeExternal(ObjectOutput out) throws IOException { //The method is ignored during record serialization
    }
    @Override
    public void readExternal(ObjectInput in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException { //The method is ignored during record serialization
    }
  }
