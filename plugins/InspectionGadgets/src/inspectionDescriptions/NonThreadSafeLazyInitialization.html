This inspection reports any instances of static variables being lazily initialized
in an non-thread-safe manner.   Lazy initialization of static variables should be done
in an appropriate synchronization construct, to prevent different threads from
performing conflicting initialization.  If applicable, non-lazy initialization
(e.g., in a static initializer block) is probably a better idea, as the JVM
guarantees thread-safety of such initializations.
