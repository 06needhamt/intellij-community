Reports references to classes in field types and method signatures where a field or a method exposes a class
with more restricted visibility than the field or the method itself.
<p>
  Examples are a <b>public</b> method which returns a <b>private</b> inner class, or a <b>protected</b> field
  whose type is a package-visible class.<br>
  While legal Java, such fields and methods aren't useful outside of the visibility scope of the classes used in the field or the method.
<p>
  In addition to that, in Java 9 a module may hide some of its classes by not exporting their packages.<br>
  If the public API of a class in an exported package references a class from non-exported package,
  such API isn't useful outside of the module.
