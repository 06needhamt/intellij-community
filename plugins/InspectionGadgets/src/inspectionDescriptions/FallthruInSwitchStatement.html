This inspection reports any instances of 'fallthrough' in a <b><font color="#000080">switch</font></b> statement.
'Fallthrough' is defined to occur when a series of executable statements after a switch label is not guaranteed.
to transfer control before the next switch label.  In that case, control 'falls through' to the statements after
that switch label, even though the switch expression does not equal the value of the fallen-through label.
While occasionally intended, this construction is confusing, and often the result of a typo.
