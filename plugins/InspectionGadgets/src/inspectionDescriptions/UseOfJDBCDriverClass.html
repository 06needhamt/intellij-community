Reports any uses of concrete JDBC driver classes. Use of such classes will
bind your project to a specific database and driver, defeating the purpose of JDBC and
resulting in loss of portability.
<p>Example: </p>
<pre>
  import java.awt.peer.ButtonPeer;

  abstract class Sample implements ButtonPeer {
    public void foo() {
        Sample sample;
    }
  }
</pre>
