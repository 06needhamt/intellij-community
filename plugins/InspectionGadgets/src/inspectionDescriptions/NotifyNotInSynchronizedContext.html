This inspection reports on any call to <b><font color="#000080">notify()</font></b> not made inside a corresponding synchronized
statement or synchronized method.  Calling <b><font color="#000080">notify()</font></b> on an object
without holding a lock on that object will result in an IllegalMonitorStateException being thrown.
Such a construct is not necessarily an error, as the necessary lock may be acquired before
the containing method is called, but it's worth  looking at.
