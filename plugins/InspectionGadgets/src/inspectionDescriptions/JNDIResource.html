Reports any JNDI resource which is not safely closed. JNDI resources reported
by this inspection include <code>javax.naming.InitialContext</code>,
and <code>javax.naming.NamingEnumeration</code>.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  Object findObject(Properties properties, String name) throws NamingException {
    Context context = new InitialContext(properties); //context is not closed
    return context.lookup(name);
  }
</pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the first checkbox below to specify if a JNDI Resource is allowed to be opened inside a <code>try</code>
block. This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a resource
in front of a <code>try</code> block.
</p>
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to specify that the inspection should not warn if a JNDI resource is passed as a method call argument.
If enabled the inspection assumes the resource is closed in the called method.
Method calls inside a <code>finally</code> block with <code>close</code> in the name and a JNDI resource argument will not be ignored.
