This inspection reports instances of the "Feature Envy" code smell.  Feature
envy is defined as occuring when a method calls methods on another class three
or more times.  Calls to library classes, parent classes, contained or containing
classes are not counted for purposes of this inspection.  Feature 
envy is often an indication that functionality is in the wrong class, and may
profitably be moved.
