This inspection reports any instances of <b><font color="#000080">.wait()</font></b>
being called while the current thread is holding two locks.  Since the call to <b><font color="#000080">.wait()</font></b>
only frees locks on the it's target, waiting with two locks held can easily lead to deadlock.
