Reports cases where assignment's right hand side is a division that probably shouldn't be truncated to integer.
<p>
  For example the following code doesn't change <b>x</b> cause of integer division result:
<pre><code>
  <b>int</b> x = 18;
  x *= 3/2;
</code></pre>
So it should be replaced with:
<pre><code>
  <b>int</b> x = 18;
  x *= 3.0/2;
</code></pre>
