<font face="verdana" size="-1">This inspection reports any instances of the forward (/) or backward (\) slash in a string or
character literal.  These characters are commonly used as file separators, and portability may suffer if their use is hardcoded.
This will not report instances of the forward slash immediately following a '<' character,
or immediately preceeding a '>' character, as those often indicate XML or HTML tags, rather than file names.
