Reports calls to assertion methods with “expected” and “actual” arguments of incompatible types. Such calls often indicate that there is a bug.
The inspection applies to the following methods:<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>assertEquals(), assertNotEquals()</b></li>
  <li><b>assertSame(), assertNotSame()</b></li>
</ul>
The <b>assertNotEquals()</b> and <b>isNotEqualTo()</b> methods are also reported, however they use a weak warning
to take into account the case when the equals() contract is tested.
