This inspection reports possible escapes of 'this' during object construction.
Escapes occur when 'this' is used as a method argument or the object of an assignment
in a constructor or initializer.  Such escapes may result in subtle bugs, as the object is now available in a context
in which it is not guaranteed to be initialize.
