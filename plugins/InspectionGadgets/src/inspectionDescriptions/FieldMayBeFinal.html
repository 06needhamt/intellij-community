Reports any fields which may safely be made <code>final</code>.
Using <code>final</code> variables makes code more error-prone and
might lead to some additional compiler optimisations that will make your program run faster.
<p>Field may safely be made <code>final</code> only if it's <code>private</code> (or defined in local / anonymous class) and:
<ul>
  <li>It is <code>static</code> and initialized either in its declaration or in one static class initializer</li>
  <li>It is non-static and initialized either in its declaration or in one non-static class initializer or in all constructors</li>
</ul>
