This inspection reports any instances of fields which are accessed three or more times by a given method,
or which are accessed in a loop.  While such field access may be logically correct, it is often more performant
to replace such accesses with local variables, copying the fields to a temporary local and copying back if necessary.
<p>
Use the checkbox below to ignore instances of <b><font color="#000080">final</font></b> fields being repeatedly accessed, as many compilers and JVMs
can optimize that case without explicit creation of a temporary local variable.   Constant fields are always ignored by this inspection.
