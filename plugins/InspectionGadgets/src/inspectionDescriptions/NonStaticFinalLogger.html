Reports logger fields on classes which are not declared <code>static</code> and <code>final</code>.
Ensuring that every classes logger is effectively constant and bound to that class
simplifies the task of providing a unified logging implementation for an application. Interfaces,
enumerations, annotations and inner classes are not reported by this inspection.
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>
  <b>public class</b> Significant {
    <b>private</b> Logger LOG = Logger.getLogger(Critical.class);
  }
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick fix is applied, the result looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>
  <b>public class</b> Significant {
    <b>private static final</b> Logger LOG = Logger.getLogger(Critical.class);
  }
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the table below to specify Logger class names.
Fields which have a type equal to one of the class names specified and which are not <code>static</code>
and <code>final</code>, will be reported by this inspection.
