This inspection reports any instances of <b><font color="#000080">Serializable</font></b> non-static
inner classes whose outer classes are non-<b><font color="#000080">Serializable</font></b>.  Such classes
are unlikely to serialize correctly, due to implicit references from the inner to outer class.
<p>
Use the checkbox below to specify whether this inspection should report classes which are only serializable
due to inheriting from serializable classes.  Such classes are often not intended for serialization, and so
this inspection would report unnecessarily.
