This inspection reports any instances of parameters which have different names from corresponding
parameters in methods they override.  While legal in Java, such inconsistent names may be confusing,
and lessen the documentation benefits of good naming practices.
<p>
    Use the checkbox below to indicate whether overridden parameter names which are only
a single character long should be ignored.  This is useful if you do not wish to be bound
by some dubious naming conventions used int the JDK.
