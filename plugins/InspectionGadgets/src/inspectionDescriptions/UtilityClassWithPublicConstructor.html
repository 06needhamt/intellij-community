This inspection reports any instances of utility classes with <b><font color="#000080">public</font></b>  constructors.  Utility
classes have all fields and methods declared 'static'. Giving such classes a <b><font color="#000080">public</font></b>
constructor is confusing, and may lead to the class being inadvertantly instantiated.
