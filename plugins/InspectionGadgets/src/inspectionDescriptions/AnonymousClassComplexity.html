This inspection reports any instances of anonymous inner classes with too high of a total complexity.  The
total complexity of a class is the sum of the cyclomatic complexities of all the methods
and initializers the class declares.  Inherited methods and initializers are not counted
toward the total complexity.  Anonymous classes with more than very low complexities may be
difficult to understand, and should probably be promoted to become named inner classes.
