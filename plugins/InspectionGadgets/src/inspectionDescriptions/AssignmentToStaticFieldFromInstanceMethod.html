Reports any assignments to <code>static</code> fields from within
instance methods, including increments and decrements.
While legal, such assignments are tricky to do
safely, and are often a result of fields being inadvertently marked
<code>static</code>.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
class Counter {
  private static int count = 0;

  void increment() {
    // Warning: updating the static field from the instance method
    count++;
  }
}
</pre>
