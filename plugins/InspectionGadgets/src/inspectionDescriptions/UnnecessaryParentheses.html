Reports on any instance of unnecessary parentheses. Parentheses
are considered unnecessary if the evaluation order of an expression remains
unchanged if the parentheses are removed.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  int n = 3 + (9 * 8);
</pre>
<p>After quick-fix is applied, the result will be:</p>
<pre>
  int n = 3 + 9 * 8;
</pre>

Use the first checkbox below to ignore parentheses which help to clarify a binary
expression. Parentheses are clarifying if the expression parenthesized is an
<code>instanceof</code> expression part of a larger
expression or has a different operator than the parent expression.
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to ignore any parentheses around the condition
of conditional expressions. Some coding standards specify that all such conditions
must be surrounded by parentheses.
<p>
Use the third checkbox below to ignore parentheses around a single lambda parameter within a lambda expression.
