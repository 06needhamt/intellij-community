This inspection reports any instances of methods on JUnit classes whose names start with "test" but
which are not declared
<b><font color="#000080">public</font></b>, do not return <b><font color="#000080">void</font></b>, or which take arguments.
Such test methods are easy to create inadvertantly,
and will not be executed by JUnit tests runners.
