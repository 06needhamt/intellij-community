This inspection reports any instances of <b><font color="#000080">Serializable</font></b> non-static
inner classes which do not provide a <b><font color="#000080">serialVersionUID</font></b> field.
Without a  <b><font color="#000080">serialVersionUID</font></b> field, any change to a class will make previously serialized versions unreadable.
It is strongly recommended that <b><font color="#000080">Serializable</font></b> non-static inner classes have
a <b><font color="#000080">serialVersionUID</font></b> field, otherwise the default serialization algorithm
may result in serialized versions being incompatible between compilers, due to differences in synthetic
accessor methods.
<p>
Use the checkbox below to specify whether this inspection should report classes which are only serializable
due to inheriting from serializable classes.  Such classes are often not intended for serialization, and so
this inspection would report unnecessarily.
