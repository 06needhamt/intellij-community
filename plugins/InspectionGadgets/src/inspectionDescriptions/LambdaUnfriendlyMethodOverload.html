Reports overloaded methods or constructors with similar functional interface type parameters for which
any call sites will need a cast or parameter type specified on the lambda expression to resolve ambiguity.
Such calls can look ugly and should be avoided if possible.
It is preferable to give the overloaded methods a different name from each other, so that this problem does not occur.

<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
interface MyExecutor {
  void execute(Supplier<?> supplier);
  void execute(Callable<?> callable);
}
</pre>
<p>
Here, both <code>Supplier</code> and <code>Callable</code> are functional interfaces that accept single argument and have return value.
As a result, it's not possible to call either of these methods with a lambda argument. If both methods are necessary it's better to
rename one of them to avoid ambiguity.
