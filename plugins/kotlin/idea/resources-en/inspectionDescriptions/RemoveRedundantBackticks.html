Reports redundant backticks in references.
<p>
    Some of the Kotlin keywords are valid identifiers in Java: in, object, is, and other.
    If a Java library uses a Kotlin keyword for a method, you can still call the method escaping it with the backtick (`) character, e.g.
    "foo.`is`(bar)".
    Sometimes escaping is redundant and can be safely omitted. The inspection is aimed to discover and report such cases and
    paired 'Remove redundant backticks' quick-fix allows to amend highlighted code snippet.

<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>
   fun `is`(x: String) {}
   fun foo() {
      `is`("bar") // <== 'is' is a keyword, backticks are required
   }

   fun `test that smth works as designed`() // <== it's ok, complex identifier for readability improvement

   val `a` = 1  // <== no need for backticks
</code></pre>
