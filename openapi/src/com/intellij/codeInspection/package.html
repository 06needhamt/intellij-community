Provides interfaces for registering and implementing code inspections. To register inspections,
a plugin should implement the {@link InspectionToolProvider} interface and return the
list of inspection classes from the <code>getInspectionClasses()</code> method.
An inspection is a class extending {@link LocalInspectionTool}. During background code
analysis or when the "Inspect Code..." action is invoked,, IDEA calls the inspection
to inspect individual files, classes, methods and fields, and if the inspection detects any problems,
it returns an array of {@link ProblemDescriptor} classes reporting the problem. Each problem
descriptor can return a list of {@link LocalQuickFix} classes, each of which represents an
action which the user can invoke by pressing Alt-Enter in order to fix the problem detected
by the inspection.
