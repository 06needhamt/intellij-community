Dom UI Controls serve to edit DOM elements (DomElement class) in UI forms. They have 2 basic methods:
commit() and reset(). The former updates DOM Element to match the input in control, the latter - updates
UI to match DOM contents. They're usually called by system on top-level editor pages after such events
as focus lost and undo. Dom Controls are usually bound to Swing controls by method bind().
<p>

  Basic controls are:
<li>StringControl: bound to JTextComponent, edits GenericDomValue&lt;String>
<li>BigStringControl: bound to BigStringComponent (text field with browse button), edits GenericDomValue&lt;String>
<li>PsiClassControl: bound to TextFieldWithBrowseButton , edits GenericDomValue&lt;PsiClass>
<li>BooleanControl: bound to JCheckBox, edits GenericDomValue&lt;Boolean>
<li>ComboControl: bound to JComboBox, edits GenericDomValue&lt;T>, where T may be String, enum or something other

<p>
  BasicDomElementComponent supports auto-binding Swing controls to auto-created corresponding DOM Controls
  based on parent DOM Element children and class fields, that makes easy to design DOM UI forms.
  <p>
  DomCollectionControl is table control for viewing and editing collection elements. One should specify parent
  DOM element, collection child description and ColumnInfo's. The Control is bound to DomCollectionPanel.
