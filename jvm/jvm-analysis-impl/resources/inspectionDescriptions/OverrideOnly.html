Reports calls to API methods marked with <code>@ApiStatus.OverrideOnly</code>.
<p>
  The <code>@ApiStatus.OverrideOnly</code> annotation indicates that the method is part of SPI (Service Provider Interface).
  Clients of the declaring library should implement or override such methods, not call them directly.
  Marking a class or interface with this annotation means that the client could only implement or override any of the methods,
  but not to call them.
