Reports usages of API marked as unstable with an annotation. Such API may be changed or removed in future versions breaking code what use
it.  
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
The annotations which are used to mark unstable APIs are shown in the list below. By default the inspection ignores usages of unstable APIs
if their declarations are located in sources of the same project, because in such cases it'll be possible to update usages when you change APIs.
However it may be inconvenient if the project is big, so one can switch off 'Ignore API declared in this project' option to report usages
of unstable APIs declared both in the project sources and in the libraries.
