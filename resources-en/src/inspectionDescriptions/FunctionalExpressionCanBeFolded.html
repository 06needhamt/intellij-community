This inspection reports method references or lambda expressions which point to a method of their own functional interface type and hence can be replaced with their qualifiers:

<code>Runnable r = ...;</code>
<ul>
  <li><code>Runnable runnable = r::run;</code></li>
  <li><code>Runnable runnable = () -> r.run();</code>  </li>
</ul>
&rarr; <code>Runnable runnable = r;</code>
