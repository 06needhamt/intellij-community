This inspection reports method calls to methods of functional interfaces which are directly invoked on the definition of the lambda, method reference or anonymous class.
Such method calls, including the functional interface implementation, can be replaced with the body of the functional interface implementation, like
<code>((Runnable)() -> $body$).run()</code> &rarr; <code>$body$</code>
