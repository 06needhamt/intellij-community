 * Example:
 * When searching for references to some getter method 'getFoo()',

 * In this case we order to pass all references with 'foo' text that resolve to 'getFoo()' into original processor.

 * Implementations should be registered at `com.intellij.searcher` extension point.
 *
 * It's highly advised to use [SearchService] methods to build additional queries.
