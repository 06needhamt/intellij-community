Reports when <code>list.remove(index)</code> is called inside the ascending counted loop. This is suspicious as list becomes
shorter after that, and the element next to removed will not be processed. A simple fix is to decrease the index variable after removal,
but probably removing via iterator or using <code>removeIf</code> method (since Java 8) is a more robust alternative.
If you don't expect that <code>remove</code> will be called more than once in a loop, consider adding a <code>break</code> after it.

<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    process(new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("1", "2", "|", "3", "4")));
  }

  static void process(List&ltString&gt list) {
    for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
      if (list.get(i).equals("|")) {
        list.remove(i);
        continue;
      }
      System.out.println(list.get(i));
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>Here we could expect that '1 2 3 4' will be printed, but 3 will be skipped in the output.</p>
