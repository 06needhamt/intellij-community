Reports construction of sorted collections like <code>new TreeSet&lt;&gt;()</code> which rely on natural order,
but their element type does not implement the <code>Comparable</code> interface.
Such collection will unlikely to work properly.
<p>
  A false-positive is possible if collection element is a super-type which is not comparable, but it's intended to
  hold only comparable sub-types. This is however error-prone. It's better to narrow the collection element type
  or declare the super-type as comparable.

  An option is provided to suppress the warnings on type parameters.
