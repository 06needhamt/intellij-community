Reports anonymous types which can be replaced with method references.
<p>
  Note that if an anonymous class is converted into an unbound method reference, the same method reference object
  can be reused by Java runtime during subsequent invocations, while anonymous class creates separate objects every time.
  Thus, applying the quick-fix can cause the semantics change in rare cases, e.g. when anonymous class
  instances are used as <code>HashMap</code> keys.

<p>
Method references syntax is not supported under Java 1.7 or earlier JVMs.
