Reports local variable of wrapper type which has most of its usages primitive.
<p>In some cases, boxing can be source of significant performance penalty, especially in loops.</p>
Some heuristics are applied to estimate the number of boxing operations, for example, conversions inside the loop considered
as much more common.

<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  public void example() {
    Long l = 12L;
    needBox(l);
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      needPrimitive(l); // Loops usages considered as more often
    }
  }

  void needPrimitive(long l) {}
  void needBox(Long l) {}
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied the result looks like:</p>
<pre>
  public void example() {
    long l = 12L;
    needBox(l);
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      needPrimitive(l); // Loops usages considered as more often
    }
  }

  void needPrimitive(long l) {}
  void needBox(Long l) {}
</pre>
