Reports conditions which are redundant as subsequent condition covers them completely. For example, in
condition like <code>value != -1 && value > 0</code> the first part is redundant, because if it's false
then the second part is also false. Or in condition like <code>obj != null && obj instanceof String</code>
the null-check is redundant as instanceof implies non-nullity.
