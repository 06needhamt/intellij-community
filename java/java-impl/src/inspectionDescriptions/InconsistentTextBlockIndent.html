Reports text blocks with indent that consists of both spaces and tabs.
Such cases might be misleading since one space is treated as one tab during text block processing.

<p>For example (here spaces are visualized as <code>·</code> and tabs as <code>␉</code>, one tab takes 4 spaces in editor):</p>
<pre><code>
String colors = """
····················red
␉   ␉   ␉   ␉   ␉   green
····················blue""";
</code></pre>

<p>After printing such string the result would be:</p>
<pre><code>
red
···············green
blue
</code></pre>
