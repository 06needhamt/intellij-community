Reports <code>return</code> statements that return a local variable, where the value of the variable is computed
somewhere else within the same code block with the <code>return</code> statement.
<p>The quick fix inlines the returned variable by moving the return statement to the location where the value of the variable is computed.
  When the returned value can't be inlined into the <code>return</code> statement, 
  the quick fix attempts to move the return statement as close to the computation of the returned value as possible.
<p>For example, the code below could be simplified:
<pre>
  int n = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; a.length; i++) {
    if (a[i] == b) {
      n = i;
      break;
    }
  }
  return n;
</pre>
<p>After the quick fix it becomes the following:</p>
<pre>
  int n = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; a.length; i++) {
    if (a[i] == b) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return n;
</pre>
