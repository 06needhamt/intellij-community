This inspection checks for expressions which overflow during computation.
Usually it happens by accident (for example wrong type is used or shift should be done in opposite direction) and indicates a bug.

<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>
  float a = 1.0/0.0;
  long b = 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
  long c = 1000 << 62;
</pre>
