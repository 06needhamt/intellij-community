  Reports all anonymous classes which can be replaced with lambda expressions.
  <p>
    Note that if anonymous class is converted into stateless lambda, the same lambda object 
    could be reused during subsequent invocations while anonymous class creates separate objects every time.
    Thus applying the quick-fix could cause the semantics change in rare cases, e.g. when anonymous class 
    instances are used as <code>HashMap</code> keys.

  <p>
  Lambda syntax is not supported under Java 1.7 or earlier JVMs.
