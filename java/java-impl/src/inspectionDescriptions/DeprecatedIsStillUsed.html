<body>
Reports deprecated classes, methods and fields which are used in your code nonetheless.
<br>
For example:

<pre>
<code>
class MyCode {
  @Deprecated
  void oldMethod() {}// warning: "Deprecated member is still used"

  void newMethod() {
    oldMethod(); // forgotten usage
  }
}</code>
</pre>
Usages from within deprecated places are ignored.
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Due to performance reasons, a non-private member is checked only when it's name rarely occurs in the project.</p>
