Reports lambdas which can be replaced with method references. Use <a href="settings://preferences.sourceCode.Java"> File | Settings | Editor | Code Style | Java | Code Generation</a> settings to configure special method references.
<p>
  Note that if anonymous class is converted into unbound method reference, the same method reference object
  could be reused during subsequent invocations while anonymous class creates separate objects every time.
  Thus applying the quick-fix could cause the semantics change in rare cases, e.g. when anonymous class
  instances are used as <code>HashMap</code> keys.

Lambda/method references syntax is not supported under Java 1.7 or earlier JVMs.
