Reports loops whose second and the subsequent iterations do not produce any additional side effects other than produced by the first iteration,
which could indicate a programming error. Such loops may iterate only zero, one or infinite number of times.
If infinite number of times case is unreachable, such loop could be replaced with <code>if</code> statement. Otherwise there's a danger that
the program could stuck.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
    public void foo(String baseName, String names) {
        int suffix = 1;
        String name = baseName;
        while (names.contains(name)) {
            // error: suffix is not updated making loop body idempotent
            name = baseName + suffix;
        }
    }
</pre>
