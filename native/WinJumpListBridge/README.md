## Build dependencies
* C++17-compatible compiler
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) >= `v3.15` (Note: it is already shipped with CLion)
* An implementation of Java SE 11 or newer. It's highly recommended to use the JDK you are using to build IDEA;

## Build
1. You have to set the variable `JDK_PATH` to the path of JDK which will be used for build.
For example if your `javac.exe` is located at `C:\Soft\jdk\bin\javac.exe` you should set the variable like
`-DJDK_PATH="C:\Soft\jdk"`
2.
